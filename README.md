Creating Views Programmatically
Up to this point, you’ve probably used a variety of storyboards and Xib files to create your interfaces, but it’s important to know that everything you can do in Interface Builder you can also do using code.
Assignment:
1. Explore the sample and fully understand it.
2. Recreate the sample project
3. Create a new project of your own design that has an entirely programmatic UI. Make
it look good.
4. Add a square in the bottom right corner.
5. No matter the orientation, the square should always appear in the bottom right
corner.
